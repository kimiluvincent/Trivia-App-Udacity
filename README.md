# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application must:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others.

## Starting and Submitting the Project

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the project repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your machine. Work on the project locally and make sure to push all your changes to the remote repository before submitting the link to your repository in the Classroom.

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The [backend](./backend/README.md) directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in `__init__.py` to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. These are the files you'd want to edit in the backend:

1. `backend/flaskr/__init__.py`
2. `backend/test_flaskr.py`

> View the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for more details.

### Frontend

The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. If you have prior experience building a frontend application, you should feel free to edit the endpoints as you see fit for the backend you design. If you do not have prior experience building a frontend application, you should read through the frontend code before starting and make notes regarding:

1. What are the end points and HTTP methods the frontend is expecting to consume?
2. How are the requests from the frontend formatted? Are they expecting certain parameters or payloads?

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API. The places where you may change the frontend behavior, and where you should be looking for the above information, are marked with `TODO`. These are the files you'd want to edit in the frontend:

1. `frontend/src/components/QuestionView.js`
2. `frontend/src/components/FormView.js`
3. `frontend/src/components/QuizView.js`

By making notes ahead of time, you will practice the core skill of being able to read and understand code and will have a simple plan to follow to build out the endpoints of your backend API.

# My First App by Name "Trivia" to document 


This is a trivia app that is an assignment by udacity through the ALX program. The idea behind the app is to create a bond between the students and employees at Udacity. The application must 
1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

By completing this project it was enough justification that I have learned and I am able to apply skills and implemment well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API develoment practices

# General Guidelines
This project contains TODOs that I have completed as part of the asssignment for completion of Full stack developer nanodegree course. The frontend section forms aslo contains the TODOs part that I had to complete in order to form with a complete reference in order to match the endpoints and programmed behaviour.

## Getting started 
### Pre-requisities and Local Deevelopment

Developers using this project should already have python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

#### Backend
From the backend folder run 'pip install requirements.txt'. all required packages are included in the requirements file

To run the application rexcute the following commnads

'''
export FLASKR_APP=flaskr
flask run --reload
'''
These commands put the applicAtion in ndevelopment and directs our application to use '__init__.py' file inn our flaskr folder. working in development mode shows an interactive debuuger in console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally in windwows look for commands in [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

This application is running on 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' by default and is a proxy in the frondend configuration.

### Frondend
From the frondend folder, run the following commands to start the client:

'''
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start
''

By default the frondend wil run on localhost:3000.


### Tests

In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

'''
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaksr.py

'''

The first time you run the tests, omit the drop db command

All testt are kept in that file and should be mantained as updates are to the app functionality.

### API Reference

### Getting Starteed

- base URL: At present this app can only run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at default, 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/', which is set as proxy in the frondend configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API  Keys


### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON obbjects in the following formart:

''' {
    "success": False,
    "error":400,
    "message":"bad request"
    }
'''

THe API will return three errors when the request fails
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: resource not found
- 422: unprocessable

### Endpoints

    - Returns a list of questions objects, success value and total number of questions
